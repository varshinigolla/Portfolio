              <p>The COVID-19 Awareness and Support Platform is a multi-page responsive website designed to provide comprehensive information on COVID-19, including symptoms, preventive measures, vaccination details, and a donation system to help the underprivileged. The front-end of the platform was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience across various devices. The website includes features such as user registration, login, and donation capabilities, providing users with the option to securely contribute to COVID-19 relief efforts.

                For the back-end, I utilized MySQL as the database management system to handle user authentication, donation records, and other dynamic content. PHP was used to develop server-side logic, facilitating secure form submissions, data retrieval, and user interactions. The integration of MySQL with PHP ensured efficient data management and secure handling of sensitive user information. This project strengthened my full-stack development skills, particularly in database integration, user authentication, and handling secure transactions in a web application.</p>
